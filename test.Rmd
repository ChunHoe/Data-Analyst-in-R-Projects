**R Instructions**

-This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

-Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

-Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

-When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

-The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

In this project, I will analyze data from the New York City school department to understand whether parent, teacher, and student perceptions of the following factors affect average school SAT scores (an indicator of academic performance):

1. Safety
2. Engagement
3. Communication
4. Academics

The data, collected in 2011, are publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2011-NYC-School-Survey/mnz3-dyi8).

I'll start by installing the packages that I'll need for this analysis:


```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(purrr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
###3. New York City Schools Survey Data
Import data into R
```{r}
combined<-read_csv("~/CHL/DataQuest R/combined.csv")
survey<-read_tsv("~/CHL/DataQuest R/masterfile11_gened_final.txt")
survey_d75<-read_tsv("~/CHL/DataQuest R/masterfile11_d75_final.txt")
```
EDA Combined
```{r}
head(combined)
dim(combined)
```
EDA Survey
```{r}
head(survey)
dim(survey)
```
EDA survey_d75
```{r}
head(survey_d75)
dim(survey_d75)
```
EDA Results
-Key to join the survey data to the combined data set= "DBN"

###4. Simplifying the Data Frames
Simplify survey and survey_d75 by including only relevant variables
```{r}
survey_select<-survey%>%
  select(dbn:aca_tot_11)
dim(survey_select)

survey_d75_select<-survey_d75%>%
  select(dbn:aca_tot_11)
dim(survey_d75_select)
```
Explore variations of schooltype
```{r}
unique(survey_select$schooltype)

unique(survey_d75_select$schooltype)
```
Filter survey DF to include only observations for high schools
```{r}
survey_select<-survey_select%>%
  filter(schooltype=="High School")
dim(survey_select)
```
###5. Creating a Single Data Frame for Analysis
Combine the general education and District 75 survey data frames using the dplyr function bind_rows()
```{r}
survey_combined<-bind_rows(survey_select,survey_d75_select)
dim(survey_combined)
```
Check to make sure that there is a key you can use. 
```{r}
combined_column_names<-colnames(combined)
print("combined")
print(combined_column_names)

survey_combined_names<-colnames(survey_combined)
print("survey_combined")
print(survey_combined_names)

```
Rename variables
```{r}
survey_combined<-survey_combined%>%
  rename(DBN=dbn,school_name=schoolname)
print(colnames(survey_combined))
```
Join the new survey data frame you created to the combined data frame that contains the NYC schools data you cleaned in this mission.
```{r}
single_DF<-combined%>%left_join(survey_combined,by="DBN")
dim(single_DF)
```
###6. Look for Interesting Correlations and Examine Relationships Using Scatter Plots
Create a correlation matrix to look for interesting relationships between pairs of variables in the new, combined data frame you created. 
```{r}
cor_mat<-single_DF%>%
  select(avg_sat_score,saf_p_11:aca_tot_11)%>%
  cor(use="pairwise.complete.obs")

#print(cor_mat)


```
convert the correlation matrix to a tibble
```{r}
cor_tib<-cor_mat%>%
  as_tibble(rownames="variable")
print(cor_tib)
```
Look for correlations of other variables with `avg_sat_score` that are greater than 0.25 or less than -0.25 (strong correlations).
```{r}
strong_correlations<-cor_tib%>%
  select(variable,avg_sat_score)%>%
  filter(avg_sat_score > 0.25 | avg_sat_score < -0.25)
print(strong_correlations)
```
Make scatter plots of those variables with `avg_sat_score` to examine relationships more closely.
```{r}
create_scatter<-function(x,y){
  ggplot(data=single_DF)+
    aes_string(x=x,y=y,color=x)+
    geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
    theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="white"))+
    xlim(4,10)
  }
x_var=strong_correlations$variable[2:5]
y_var=strong_correlations$variable[1]
scatter_plots<-map2(x_var,y_var,create_scatter)
print(scatter_plots)
```
Results of correlations results
-avg_sat_score correlates moderate positive with the variables saf_t_11, saf_s_11, aca_s_11, saf_tot_11
-avg_sat_score correlates moderate positive with the variables saf_t_11, saf_s_11, saf_tot_11. However, weak or no correlation is found with saf_p_11. The opinion of both student and teacher are in line regarding safety and respect, but not with the parents opinion.
-the academic expectations of the student correlates moderate positive with avg_sat_results.

###7. Differences in Student, Parent, and Teacher Perceptions: Reshape the Data
Use the tidyr function gather() to reshape your data frame so that the survey question (like saf_p_11 and com_s_11) and the score (like 8.7 or 9.0) are in two separate columns.

```{r}
single_DF_gather<-single_DF%>%
  gather(key="survey_question",value=score,saf_p_11:aca_tot_11)
```
Create new variable "response_type": With the values to indicate "parent," "teacher," "student," or "total"
```{r}
print(unique(single_DF_gather$survey_question))

single_DF_gather<-single_DF_gather%>%
  mutate(response_type=ifelse(str_sub(survey_question,4,6) == "_p_" , "parent",
                              ifelse(str_sub(survey_question,4,6) == "_t_" , "teacher",
                                     ifelse(str_sub(survey_question,4,6) =="_s_" , "student",
                                            ifelse(str_sub(survey_question,4,6) == "_to" , "total" , "NA")))))
```
Create new variable	metric: With the values to indicate "engagement," "academic expectations," "safety and respect," or "communication"
```{r}
single_DF_gather<-single_DF_gather%>%
  mutate(metric=str_sub(survey_question,1,3))

single_DF_gather<-single_DF_gather%>%
  mutate(metric=ifelse(metric == "saf" , "safety and respect",
                       ifelse(metric == "com" , "communication",
                              ifelse(metric == "eng" , "engagement",
                                     ifelse(metric == "aca" , "academic expectations" , "NA")))))
```
Explore differences in parent, teacher, and student perceptions of NYC school quality metrics using summary statistics or creating visualizations like box plots.

grouped_by_response_type
```{r}
grouped_by_response_type<-single_DF_gather%>%
  drop_na(score)%>%
  group_by(response_type,metric)%>%
  summarize(mean(score))
  #filter(metric=="academic expectations")

print(colnames(grouped_by_response_type))
print(grouped_by_response_type)
ggplot(data=grouped_by_response_type)+
  aes(x=response_type,y=`mean(score)`,fill=response_type)+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="white"))+
  facet_wrap(~metric,nrow=1)
  labs(title="parent, teacher, and student perceptions of NYC school quality metrics")

  #facet_wrap(~response_type)+
  labs(title="parent, teacher, and student perceptions of NYC school quality metrics")


```

Correlations
```{r}
x_var=strong_correlations$variable[2:5]
y_var=strong_correlations$variable[1]
print(x_var)
print(y_var)

single_DF_gather_filtered<-single_DF_gather%>%
  filter(survey_question == x_var)%>%
  drop_na(score)

ggplot(data=single_DF_gather_filtered)+
  aes(x=score,y=avg_sat_score,color=survey_question)+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="white"))+
  facet_wrap(~survey_question,nrow=2)

ggplot(data=single_DF_gather_filtered)+
  aes(x=score,y=avg_sat_score,color=survey_question)+
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)+
  theme(panel.background=element_rect(fill="white"))


```


Findings
-Parents have on average higher perceptions of NYC school quality metrics, while students have the lowest perceptions.
-Teachers perceptions have the highest variance, while the parents perception have the lowest variance
-Both teacher and student have higher perception on academic expectations, but the lowest on communication
